Version Change: [NEW] → 1.0.0
Change Type: Initial ratification (MAJOR)

Modified Principles:
- ALL PRINCIPLES: Initial definition for publishing project

Added Sections:
- Core Principles (5 principles defined)
- Content Standards (quality requirements)
- Development Workflow (process requirements)
- Governance (amendment procedures)

Removed Sections:
- None (initial version)

Template Consistency Status:
✅ plan-template.md - Reviewed, no updates needed (constitution gates flexible)
✅ spec-template.md - Reviewed, aligned with prioritized user stories
✅ tasks-template.md - Reviewed, aligned with phased implementation approach
⚠ Commands directory - Not present in this project (N/A)

Follow-up TODOs:
- None - all placeholders filled with project-appropriate values

Rationale:
This is the initial constitution for the "Elevating Software Quality" publishing 
project. The principles are tailored for content creation, Jekyll static site 
generation, and automated deployment via GitHub Actions. This differs from 
software library development constitutions by focusing on content quality, 
accessibility, SEO, and deployment automation rather than library-first or 
CLI-first principles.

# Elevating Software Quality Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content-First

Every feature enhances content creation, discovery, or consumption. Content MUST be:

- Written in clear, accessible markdown format
- Independently valuable (each article stands alone)
- Properly structured with frontmatter metadata
- Version-controlled and auditable

**Rationale**: Content is the primary deliverable. All technical infrastructure exists to serve content quality, accessibility, and discoverability.

### II. Static-First Architecture

The site MUST remain a static Jekyll site deployable to GitHub Pages. All features MUST:

- Generate static HTML/CSS/JS at build time
- Avoid runtime server dependencies
- Support offline browsing once loaded
- Enable fast, cacheable delivery via CDN

**Rationale**: Static sites provide security, performance, simplicity, and free hosting via GitHub Pages. Avoiding runtime servers reduces maintenance burden and attack surface.

### III. Automated Deployment (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every merge to `main` MUST trigger automated build and deployment. The deployment pipeline MUST:

- Build the Jekyll site via GitHub Actions
- Validate build success before deployment
- Deploy to GitHub Pages automatically
- Provide PR preview artifacts for testing

**Rationale**: Manual deployment creates bottlenecks and risks. Automation ensures consistency, reduces errors, and enables rapid iteration.

### IV. Accessibility and Performance

All content and UI MUST meet accessibility and performance standards:

- Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for all images
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, desktop
- Page load time < 3 seconds on 3G
- Lighthouse score ≥ 90 for Accessibility and Performance

**Rationale**: Content must be accessible to all users regardless of device or ability. Performance directly impacts user experience and SEO ranking.

### V. SEO and Discoverability

Content MUST be optimized for search engines and social sharing:

- Descriptive titles and meta descriptions
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for rich snippets
- Social media meta tags (Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- Sitemap and RSS feed generation
- Internal linking strategy

**Rationale**: Quality content has no value if users cannot find it. SEO and social optimization maximize reach and impact.

## Content Standards

All published content MUST adhere to these quality requirements:

- **Accuracy**: Technical claims must be verifiable and cited where appropriate
- **Clarity**: Writing must be clear, concise, and jargon-free (or jargon explained)
- **Structure**: Proper use of headings, lists, code blocks, and visual hierarchy
- **Code Examples**: All code must be tested, syntax-highlighted, and include context
- **Tone**: Professional yet approachable; educational without being condescending
- **Length**: Articles should be comprehensive but focused (1500-3000 words ideal)

## Development Workflow

### Content Creation Process

1. Draft post in `_posts/` with proper naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
2. Include complete frontmatter (title, date, categories, layout)
3. Test locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
4. Create PR for review (triggers build artifact generation)
5. Address feedback and merge to `main`
6. Automatic deployment to production

### Technical Changes Process

1. Test changes locally with `bundle exec jekyll build && bundle exec jekyll serve`
2. Verify responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
3. Run Lighthouse audit for performance/accessibility
4. Create PR with description of changes and screenshots
5. Review and merge (triggers automatic deployment)

### Quality Gates

All PRs MUST pass:

- ✅ Jekyll build succeeds without errors or warnings
- ✅ No broken internal links
- ✅ All images have alt text
- ✅ Markdown formatting consistent with existing content
- ✅ Frontmatter complete and valid

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices and conventions.

**Amendment Procedure**:

- Amendments require documented rationale and impact analysis
- Use `/speckit.constitution` command to update constitution
- Version increments according to semantic versioning:
  - MAJOR: Backward incompatible changes (e.g., removing a core principle)
  - MINOR: New principles or sections added
  - PATCH: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic fixes
- All amendments MUST be propagated to dependent templates

**Compliance Review**:

- All PRs and content reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles
- Violations require explicit justification in PR description
- Repeated violations trigger constitution review and potential amendment

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-30 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-30
