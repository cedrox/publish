# Specification Quality Checklist: Excel Data JSON API

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Iteration 1 (2025-10-30)**:
- Initial validation identified implementation details in Assumptions section (specific cloud platforms)
- Fixed by removing platform-specific references while preserving deployment constraints
- JSON mentioned in requirements is acceptable as it's part of the user's explicit requirement ("JSON API")
- All checklist items now pass

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
