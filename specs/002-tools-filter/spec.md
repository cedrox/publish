# Feature Specification: Interactive Tools Filter Page

**Feature Branch**: `002-tools-filter`  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a page to filter the data available in data\tools.json. I want to use typescript to filter locally on page qa-tools.html"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse All Tools (Priority: P1)

A website visitor lands on the QA tools page and wants to see all available tools in an organized, readable format.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation - users must be able to view the tools before filtering them. Without this, the page has no value.

**Independent Test**: Load qa-tools.html page and verify all 58 tools from tools.json are displayed with their basic information (name, description, category).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits qa-tools.html, **When** the page loads, **Then** all tools from data/tools.json are displayed in a grid or list view
2. **Given** the tools are displayed, **When** the user scrolls, **Then** they can see all tool entries with readable formatting
3. **Given** the JSON data loads successfully, **When** displaying tools, **Then** each tool shows its name, description, and category (Familly field)

---

### User Story 2 - Filter by Category (Priority: P1)

A user wants to narrow down the tool list to specific categories (e.g., "SAST/DAST", "DevOps", "Testing") to find tools relevant to their needs.

**Why this priority**: Filtering by category is the primary use case - with 58 tools, users need a way to focus on specific tool types immediately.

**Independent Test**: Select a category from the filter dropdown/checkboxes and verify only tools matching that category are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** tools are displayed, **When** user selects "SAST/DAST" category, **Then** only tools with Familly="SAST/DAST" are shown
2. **Given** a category filter is active, **When** user clears the filter, **Then** all tools are displayed again
3. **Given** multiple category options exist, **When** user changes selection, **Then** the tool list updates immediately without page reload

---

### User Story 3 - Filter by Tool Type (Priority: P2)

A user wants to filter tools by their type (e.g., "Agent", "Core", "Plugin") to find tools based on deployment characteristics.

**Why this priority**: Secondary filter that helps users refine their search after category filtering.

**Independent Test**: Select a tool type and verify only tools with matching Type field are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** tools are displayed, **When** user selects "Agent" type, **Then** only tools with Type="Agent" are shown
2. **Given** both category and type filters are active, **When** user applies both, **Then** tools matching both criteria are displayed

---

### User Story 4 - Search by Tool Name (Priority: P2)

A user knows the tool name they're looking for and wants to quickly find it using a search box.

**Why this priority**: Enables direct navigation for users who know what they want, complementing the category-based browsing.

**Independent Test**: Type a tool name (e.g., "GitHub") in the search box and verify matching tools are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a search box is available, **When** user types "GitHub", **Then** tools with "GitHub" in their name are shown
2. **Given** user is searching, **When** they type partial names (e.g., "Git"), **Then** all tools containing "Git" are displayed
3. **Given** search is active, **When** user clears the search box, **Then** all tools (respecting other filters) are shown

---

### User Story 5 - Filter by Boolean Properties (Priority: P3)

A user wants to filter tools by boolean characteristics like "Is Microsoft", "Is Local", "API", "Available as quality gate".

**Why this priority**: Advanced filtering for power users who need very specific tool characteristics.

**Independent Test**: Toggle "Is Microsoft" checkbox and verify only Microsoft tools are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** boolean filter options are available, **When** user checks "Is Microsoft", **Then** only tools where Is Microsoft=true are shown
2. **Given** multiple boolean filters are checked, **When** user applies them, **Then** tools matching all selected criteria are displayed

---

### User Story 6 - Clear All Filters (Priority: P3)

A user has applied multiple filters and wants to reset the view to see all tools again.

**Why this priority**: Convenience feature for users who want to start over without reloading the page.

**Independent Test**: Apply multiple filters, then click "Clear All" button and verify all tools are displayed with filters reset.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple filters are active, **When** user clicks "Clear All Filters" button, **Then** all filters are reset and all tools are displayed
2. **Given** filters are cleared, **When** the page updates, **Then** all filter controls return to their default state

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no tools match the applied filters? Display "No tools found" message with option to clear filters
- How does the page handle missing or malformed data in tools.json? Display error message and skip invalid entries
- What if a tool has null values for filter fields? Tool should still appear but won't match that specific filter
- How does search handle special characters or case sensitivity? Use case-insensitive matching, handle special characters gracefully
- What if JavaScript fails to load or is disabled? Display static list of all tools with a message that filtering requires JavaScript

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Page MUST load and display all tools from data/tools.json on initial load
- **FR-002**: Page MUST provide category filter based on "Familly" field values from the JSON data
- **FR-003**: Page MUST provide tool type filter based on "Type" field values from the JSON data
- **FR-004**: Page MUST provide a text search box that filters tools by name (case-insensitive partial match)
- **FR-005**: Page MUST provide boolean filters for "Is Microsoft", "Is Local", "API", and "Available as quality gate" fields
- **FR-006**: Filtering MUST occur client-side in the browser without server requests
- **FR-007**: Page MUST update the displayed tool list immediately when any filter is changed
- **FR-008**: Page MUST display tool name, description, and category for each tool in the list
- **FR-009**: Page MUST provide a "Clear All Filters" button that resets all filters to default state
- **FR-010**: Page MUST handle and display appropriate messages when no tools match the current filters
- **FR-011**: Page MUST display a loading indicator while fetching tools.json
- **FR-012**: Page MUST handle errors gracefully if tools.json fails to load or is malformed
- **FR-013**: Multiple filters MUST work in combination (AND logic - tool must match all active filters)
- **FR-014**: Page MUST be accessible via the URL path /qa-tools.html
- **FR-015**: Filter state MUST be clearly visible to users (show which filters are active)

### Key Entities

- **Tool**: Represents a software quality assurance tool with attributes including name (Tools field), description, category (Familly field), type, boolean flags (Is Microsoft, Is Local, API, Available as quality gate), and lifecycle phase indicators (Code, Build, Test, release, deploy, operate, monitor, plan)

- **Filter State**: Represents the current user-selected filters including selected category, selected type, search query text, and active boolean filters

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view all 58 tools within 2 seconds of page load (including JSON fetch time)
- **SC-002**: Filter operations complete and update the display in under 100 milliseconds
- **SC-003**: Users can successfully find a specific tool using search in under 10 seconds
- **SC-004**: Page remains responsive and functional with all 58 tools loaded
- **SC-005**: 90% of users can successfully apply and clear filters without confusion
- **SC-006**: Zero page reloads required for any filtering operation
- **SC-007**: Page displays correctly on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **SC-008**: Filter combinations reduce result set accurately (zero incorrect matches shown)

## Assumptions

- Jekyll static site will serve qa-tools.html as a standard HTML page
- The existing data/tools.json file structure will remain stable (fields won't be renamed or removed)
- Users will primarily access the page via desktop browsers (mobile optimization is not in scope for this feature)
- TypeScript will be compiled to JavaScript that runs in all modern browsers (ES2015+ support assumed)
- The 58 tools currently in the JSON file represent a typical dataset size (not planning for thousands of tools)
- Page will use the existing site theme and styling conventions from the Jekyll site
- No authentication or user accounts are needed - this is a public-facing reference page
- Tools data is read-only - no editing or management features required on this page
