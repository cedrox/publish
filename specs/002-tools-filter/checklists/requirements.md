# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Tools Filter Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation:

**Content Quality**: ✓
- Spec focuses on user needs (browsing, filtering, searching tools)
- Written from user perspective without technical implementation details
- TypeScript mentioned in input but not specified in requirements (allows implementation flexibility)
- All mandatory sections present and complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✓
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (made informed decisions based on common UI patterns)
- All 15 functional requirements are testable (can verify filter behavior, display, performance)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (2 seconds load, 100ms filter response, 90% user success)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of frameworks, libraries, or implementation)
- Six user stories with clear acceptance scenarios covering browse, filter, search, and reset flows
- Edge cases address null values, missing data, JavaScript disabled, no results, errors
- Scope clearly bounded to client-side filtering on qa-tools.html page
- Assumptions documented (JSON structure stability, browser support, dataset size)

**Feature Readiness**: ✓
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories prioritized (P1: browse and category filter, P2: type filter and search, P3: advanced filters and clear)
- All user stories independently testable as specified
- Success criteria are measurable outcomes (time, accuracy, user success rate)
- No framework names (React, Vue, Angular) or build tools mentioned
- No TypeScript specifics mentioned (only JavaScript behavior described)

**Ready for next phase**: ✓ `/speckit.plan`
